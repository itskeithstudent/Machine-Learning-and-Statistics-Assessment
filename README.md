# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Assessment

Jupyter Notebook focused repository, contains two primary notebooks for exploring different packages and interacting with them.

The aim of this repository is to demonstrate an understanding of both the sklearn and scipy.stats packages.
For sklearn an overview will be given to introduce sklearn as well as some other interesting aspects important to modelling like feature selection and cross-validation. Following this 3 different algorithms will be explored using different datasets.

In the SciPy notebook it will similarly introduce scipy.stats by giving a brief overview, and then getting into specifics will start to perform some ANOVA analysis on a dataset.

* [Running the notebooks - Prerequisites](#running-the-notebooks---prerequisites)

## Contents of repository:
* scikit-Learn.ipynb - notebook focused on the use of the scikit-learn package.
* scipy-stats.ipynb - notebook focused on the use of the scipy packages and it's stats module.
* requirements.txt - text file listing required packages.
* assessment.pdf - the project brief this repository is based on.

## Running the notebooks - Prerequisites
To run the notebooks they will require a few packages, to install these run the following command (preferably within a virtual environment):
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 Note: if not using conda you will need to do some additional set up to set up a kernel pointing to your virtual environment.
